Another atempt at writing my own editor and learning about cross-platform gui programming
in multiple languages.

This time around I am playing with python.

## Initial goals

* setup a python environment using a commong package manager
* make the Hello World app run on MacOS, Windows and Linux
* compile a bundle for Windows and MacOS
* compile a deb package for Linux
* compile a binary tarball for Linux
