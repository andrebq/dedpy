# dedpy - D Editor in Python

Another attempt at writing my own editor and learning about
cross-platform gui programming in multiple languages.

This time around I am playing with python.

## Initial goals

* setup a python environment using a common package manager
* make the Hello World app run on MacOS, Windows and Linux
* compile a bundle for Windows and MacOS
* compile a deb package for Linux
* compile a binary tarball for Linux

## Devlog

As part of the development of this project, I'll keep a crude version
of a devlog. Where I'll record any piece of information/context that
I find relevant as well as some ramblings of a grumpy dev :-D.
