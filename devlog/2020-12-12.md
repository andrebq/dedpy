# Devlog entry - 2020/12/12

As part of my learning experience and, as a reminder to myself
of all hurdles of trying something non-trivial in order to
learn python properly, I'll be writing down all my experience
as a dev log.

You dear reader (which is probably my future-self) can follow
along the entries and enjoy all the pain, or occasional joy,
that I'll experience.

## Package management hell!

Well, `pipenv` was the first choice that came to mind, as it
uses `Pipfile` and it is well regarded as a good option,
at least that was what Google said...

But real life has its ways of not being so simple as the
blogposts tend to portray it. The simplicity of `pipenv`
fell apart the moment I had to switch from MacOS to Windows...

The damn tool simply didn't work on Windows and kept complaining
about `python3.exe` not being installed in `Anaconda`, the funny
thing is that I wasn't using `python` from an `Anaconda` package...

Truth be told, I installed Anaconda in the past removed it although
the Windows Program Manager still thinks it is there but refuses
to execute the uninstaller... Go figure....

I tried to install python using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/), using
Microsoft's Windows Store and using Python's own Windows installer.
Python worked just fine in all circumstances but every time I tried
to use `pipenv` it would go back to the same error above.

In the end I gave up and tried [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/),
and it worked! I got my beautiful wxWidgets Hello World screen!
If past experience counts I'm pretty sure I'll have problems with
Poetry in MacOS. Not that I've tried it already but I'm lowering my
expectations. But rest assured that I'll mention in a future entry
how things went at Apple land. In the meantime I should get back to
wxPythoning my editor...
