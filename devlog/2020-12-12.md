# Devlog entry - 2020/12/12

As part of my learning experience and, as a reminder to myself
of all hurdles of trying something non-trivial in order to
learn python properly, I'll be writing down all my experience
as a dev log.

You dear reader (which is probably my future-self) can follow
along the entries and enjoy all the pain, or occasional joy,
that I'll experience.

## Package management hell!

Well, `pipenv` was the first choice that came to mind, as it
uses `Pipfile` and it is well regarded as a good option,
at least that was what Google said...

But real life has its ways of not being so simple as the
blogposts tend to portray it. The simplicity of `pipenv`
fell apart the moment I had to switch from MacOS to Windows...

The damn tool simply didn't work on Windows and kept complaining
about `python3.exe` not being installed in `Anaconda`, the funny
thing is that I wasn't using `python` from an `Anaconda` package...

Truth be told, I installed Anaconda in the past removed it although
the Windows Program Manager still thinks it is there but refuses
to execute the uninstaller... Go figure....

I tried to install python using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/), using
Microsoft's Windows Store and using Python's own Windows installer.
Python worked just fine in all circumstances but every time I tried
to use `pipenv` it would go back to the same error above.

In the end I gave up and tried [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/),
and it worked! I got my beautiful wxWidgets Hello World screen!
If past experience counts I'm pretty sure I'll have problems with
Poetry in MacOS. Not that I've tried it already but I'm lowering my
expectations. But rest assured that I'll mention in a future entry
how things went at Apple land. In the meantime I should get back to
wxPythoning my editor...

## Learning by reading docs

It has been awhile since I last had to spend soo much time reading
docs in order to get the basics of something. With almost 20 years
of professional experience, and a considerable chunk of my teenage
years in front of a TurboPascal screen, code tends to just flow
through my fingers as most of the programming was already done in
my head.

But hell the feeling of reading docs just to put your mind the the
right state so it can think about the programming is something I've
missed. Last time I had it was back in 2009 when learning Go right
after the first public release.

Before Python I've tried to play with Rust, but I think my mind was
too spoiled by the ease of use of Go and the lazy approach towards
memory management that years of Java/C# (lazy != reckless, but that
is a topic for another time).

Python feels different enough that my brain doesn't try to implicitly
write Java/C#/Go code yet it is familiar enough that I don't need
to learn too many new concepts all at once. In other words, I'm too
`rusty` for `Rust` (pun intended)! When trying to make sense of
any non-trivial Rust code my brain just wants to wrap everything
with `Arc<RefCell<?>>>` and that is a really good way to throw away
most benefits of `Rust` while sticking to all the downsides.

But now (or probably earlier), you might be asking yourself,
why the heck did you wrote all of this?! Well, mostly because I want
to share the reasoning behind this whole project but also because
I want to add links that I found helpful and having a context
around the links will help me in the future.
