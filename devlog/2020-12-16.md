# Devlog entry - 2020-12-16

And for today we have communication in the menu!

## Many languages and multiple ways to talk!

When two entities (biological or artificial) have to collaborate
they need to agree on some formalities/protocols and the meaning
of each piece of information they exchange.

Even the protein factory we tenderly call body cells have use a
simple (but elegant) protocol using a combination of 3 different
types of RNA to express a gene from our DNA in the form of a protein
that is then used to perform some vital function or be part of another
high-level communication system.

Computer programs are not much different that that, case in point,
the foundation of true Object-Oriented Programming and Actor systems
mimic that protocol. The key difference from Actor to True-OO is that
in Actor based systems the inherent limitations of the physical world
are taken into account -- namely uncertainty and propagation delay.

The Ded editor is intended to be an integrating development environment --
I am deliberately not using the word **integrated** as I do not want to
Ded be a dictator of how things should be integrated into it.

Now it is the time to ask why I explained about low-level simple protocols
and the _integratability_ of Ded? -- making up words right now...

The answer to that question lies in the fact Ded has to be designed such that
in some situations it will behave as a source of information and sometimes
as a sink of information. By information I mean any data to be processed.

This is akin to a P2P architecture where even though nodes are not equal in
their functionality but instead they are able to freely exchange messages.
Writing a true P2P protocol on top of raw TCP or UDP although doable is
too much for the scope of my learning exercise -- remember, Ded is a way
to learn Python and GUI programming at a non-trivial level.

As much as I would like to re-invent the wheel and in the process learn more
about wheels, I decided to take the practical -- lazy -- route and choose
to use a Pub/Sub based architecture. So basically every instance of Ded
will be connected to an MQTT broker (eventually Ded will start the broker
if one is not already running). From that broker instances can receive
messages from other applications which might change the contents of a buffer,
add/remove items from a file tree and any other action available to Ded.

The concrete API and functionality will be described in later, the target
for today is just to get message exchange between the broker and the instance.

By relying on MQTT we effectively make all nodes are treated equal except
for the broker itself, which then becomes the medium where information
flows thus being transparent to the actual interaction. As a side benefit,
MQTT with some minor tweaks could be used to exchange messages in UDP
allowing for low-latency message exchange.

## To MQTT or not?

MQTT is far from the only option when it comes to message exchange protocols,
but a lot of people are using it for embedded systems thus there is a lot of
momentum to lean upon. I considered 0mq for awhile but choose MQTT as it 
might prove useful for other projects where 0mq would not be a good fit 
(such projects are beyond the scope of this devlog).

Another approach would be something like D-Bus but I think MQTT would be easier
to setup on the environments I care about (GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS). In the
future I want to experiment with D-Bus as a cross-platform messaging system,
but I'll refrain from expanding the scope of my learning exercise.

Given that Acme was one of the Ded's primary inspirations one might ask why
not use 9P as the underlying communication protocol. The main reason is
that I wanted a P2P inspired system and 9P is pretty much Client/Server based.
One could mount a 9P server as a folder thus making it pretty much P2P,
but *mounting 9p as a folder* is not something as simple to do in all 3
platforms. If the IT as an industry had adopted Plan9 networks instead of
BSD-sockets we would be much better now but that didn't happen and now
we need K8S and its million lines of code to do something that some folks
at Bell Labs did during the 70's. It took just shy of 40 years and countless
engineering hours to rebuild that same thing...

Rant aside, I have a gut feeling that 9P would be a better option, but again
I think acquiring knowledge regarding MQTT now might be useful in the future
where 9P would definitely not be ideal. So 9P you will sit this one out...
