# Devlog entry - 2020/12/13

A rare sunday where things just worked!

## Getting two panels and a modal editor

The expected outcome of this sunday wasn't really
something complicated:

- get a center editor;
- and a left scratch area;
- modal behavior.

The first two are related to how I expect the editor
to be used. Most of the time I expect the user to be
either reading or writing a central piece with a
place to write down notes about the main topic,
plus the occasional copy/paste of some reference text.

Around that central piece the user might have a number of
auxiliary text/content (eventually even a bare-bones HTML
viewer). The visibility of this content has to be controlled
with the least amount of keystrokes (probably ESC + <some key>),
such that the user focus can move from Narrow (focus only on the
main topic) to Wide (focus on information around the main topic) 
in a pleasant way.

The third one, is simply a personal preference, but I really like
modal editors VIM and the various VIM-Mode plugins being the
prime example.

Since the command has the intention to mimic some aspects of acme,
the user will be able to execute commands either by clicking on
buttons (Insert/Navigate modes) or by pressing a combination of keys
(Insert/Navigate modes). The API is yet to be defined but I suspect
that I'll allow commands to `lock` the UI (aka, move it to Navigate
mode and disable input from the user). That way commands could
have some degree of control over a text buffer.

Obviously this `lock` will be for each buffer, such that the program
itself is still responsive.

The major difference between Insert/Navigate modes is how input
from user is handled:

- while on `insert` anything the user types is processed by the
Scintilla component, with some minor filtering done by Ded itself.

- while on `navigation` anything the user types is processed by
Ded itself, keys that have an action associated with them will trigger
that action otherwise the content will be accumulated in a buffer
for later processing.

## Colors....

Choosing the default color scheme is always a complicated task,
while I'm in favor of dark mode everywhere (old eyes with astigmatism),
I know that ergonomics studies suggest that some form of pale yellow is
recommended for when you will be looking at text for longer periods of time.

I don't really have links for those papers as this has become tacit knowledge,
and I'm too lazy to do a book/paper review (at least for this
initial experiment).

At the same time I wanted to have some pink/neon twist in my editor,
mostly because of the whole `Blackest black` vs `Pinkest pink` war.
But knowing that a Neon based editor is probably too much I searched for a
Neon Pastel palette and found this one:

https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/34093

- #fcc8ff 	(252,200,255) - aka The Pink
- #f9fedc 	(249,254,220) - aka The Yellow
- #c9aeff 	(201,174,255)
- #2b90f5 	(43,144,245)
- #d9ffd8 	(217,255,216)

If you didn't follow the link, that palette contains a pale yellow, which
I'm sure won't be `the right yellow`, it is good enough for something
that I got form a quick Google search.

With all that said, ded default color palette will be this one.
